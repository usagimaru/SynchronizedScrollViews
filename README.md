# SynchronizedScrollViews
Synchronizes the scrolling of two NSScrollViews.

## Note 1

There is a problem that simply changing NSClipView.bounds does not synchronize the movement when bounced by trackpad input. The following methods all have this problem:

```swift
let newOffset: NSPoint = ‚Ä¶
// A üëé
trackerScrollView.contentView.scroll(newOffset)
// B üëé
trackerScrollView.contentView.bounds.origin = newOffset
// C üëé
trackerScrollView.documentView?.scroll(newValue)
```

However, using NSScrollView‚Äôs [`scroll(_ clipView: NSClipView, to point: NSPoint)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/1531337-scroll) works perfectly. Use it for scrollview synchronization.

```swift
let newOffset: NSPoint = ‚Ä¶
// D üëç
trackerScrollView.scroll(trackerScrollView.contentView, to: newOffset)

// And call it to adjust scrollers
trackerScrollView.reflectScrolledClipView(trackerScrollView.contentView)
```

## Note 2

I also tried bypassing [`scrollWheel(with: NSEvent)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/1534192-scrollwheel) event to another scroll view. However, this is very inaccurate and not practical for scroll synchronization. Frame rate drops and coordinates jump occasionally.
